# reproducible-workflows
This is a trial workflow for using Git, RMarkdown and Google Docs for a reproducible, collaborative workflow.

In this repository, I document the steps for creating a new project repository, cloning and pushing code changes to Github, and then using the `Trackdown` package to separately create a Google Doc from an RMarkdown file that is used for collaborative narrative work.
